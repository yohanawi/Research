                        <p>The livestock sector contributes 0.6% of Sri Lanka’s gross domestic product (GDP) and poultry
                            accounts for 50% of livestock GDP. Contribution of the livestock sector to GDP from the
                            agriculture sector has shown considerable growth in recent years and the potential of
                            poultry production in particular to contribute further to Sri Lanka’s export revenue is seen
                            as high.Currently, poultry production is the only well-established animal husbandry sector
                            in the country, which is self-sufficient in poultry products. Broiler hatching eggs and
                            broiler meat are being exported to the Middle East and Maldives, and the industry aims to
                            improve the quality of its products and target the European Union market.However, though the
                            quantity of poultry production has increased greatly, there is a need to improve the
                            efficiency of poultry production and the quality of the products if the Sri Lankan egg and
                            meat industry is to meet international quality standards and export revenue from the sector
                            be realised.Poultry farming faces significant challenges affecting productivity, quality,
                            and profitability, including manual blood spot detection, poultry diseases, meat freshness
                            assessment, and breed identification. Traditional manual methods for breed identification
                            are time-consuming and error-prone, especially when distinguishing similar breeds. </p>

                                There are a few breeds of pure chicken breeds used for poultry production in Sri Lanka,
                                such as
                                Leghorn, Australorp, Brahma, Rhoad Island Red, Wyandotte, Plymouthrock and crossbreeds
                                such
                                as Blue PlymouthRock, Golden Comet, Lohmann and and Black Star Chciken. It is important
                                for
                                farmers to know the type or breed of chicken they are buying or owning. However, many
                                farmers face difficulties when identifying the chicken breed since most chicken breeds
                                are
                                somewhat similar in appearance. Developing IoT devices for accurate embryo
                                identification is
                                essential in poultry farming. The current reliance on human verification is error-prone
                                and
                                time-consuming. Leveraging IoT, image processing, and machine learning, a reliable
                                automated
                                system for embryo detection is being developed, improving breeding management practices.
                                Ensuring the quality of chicken meat is crucial due to its increasing consumption.
                                Current
                                subjective assessment methods are inefficient and prone to errors. Our application
                                focuses
                                on accurate and efficient meat quality detection, considering variables like issue date,
                                batch date, duration, and freshness level, aided by image analysis. Poultry diseases
                                like
                                Coccidiosis and Salmonella lead to significant financial losses and affect farmers'
                                livelihoods. Visual inspection as the primary diagnosis method is prone to human error.
                                Poultry Lokka mobile application provides a more reliable and precise disease

                                <p class="justify" style="text-align: justify;">Research studies have been conducted on
                                    the identification of chicken breeds. hyperspectral imaging and chemometrics were
                                    used to identify four chicken breeds named Qingyuan, Tuxiang, Black bone, and Butter
                                    chicken. Hyperspectral data from chicken breasts (400-900 nm range) was pretreated
                                    and analyzed using three classification models: support vector machines (SVM),
                                    k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA).
                                    SVM models outperformed, achieving an average accuracy of 96.25% [2]. For embryo
                                    detection Liu and Ngadi introduce a novel method for assessing the viability and
                                    early embryo development of chicken eggs. The researchers utilized near-infrared
                                    hyperspectral imaging to capture images of eggs at different developmental stages,
                                    ranging from unfertilized eggs to three-day-old embryos. They applied two analytical
                                    approaches, principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares regression
                                    (PLSR), to identify spectral features that could accurately predict egg fertility
                                    and early embryo development. The study's findings demonstrated that the combination
                                    of near-infrared hyperspectral imaging, PCA, and PLSR achieved an impressive
                                    prediction accuracy of up to 96.7%[12]. Research studies have been conducted on the
                                    chicken freshness level identification. Traditional freshness tests for chicken meat
                                    in the food industry are cumbersome and subjective. Researchers have employed
                                    machine learning and image analysis techniques to address these issues. They
                                    achieved a remarkable 92.62% accuracy in classifying chicken meat freshness using
                                    photos taken with smartphones and the VGG16 Convolutional Neural Network. This fast
                                    and non-destructive method greatly enhances food safety and reduces losses in the
                                    industry. Future research may explore the applicability of this approach with
                                    different CNN architectures and other meat types[25]. Mbelwa and their team
                                    introduced CNN-based deep learning models for early detection of chicken diseases
                                    using fecal images from Tanzanian poultry farms. They created a dataset, enhanced
                                    it, and developed a CNN model with specific hyperparameters. The study found that
                                    the proposed CNN model achieved a high accuracy of 0.93, with XceptionNet performing
                                    best when properly calibrated at 0.94, demonstrating effective poultry disease
                                    diagnosis.</p>

                                    groundbreaking innovation in
                                    the Sri Lankan poultry industry, offering a comprehensive suite of features designed
                                    to empower poultry farmers. While many existing appliactions like "Poultry
                                    Assistant", "My Poultry Manager" provide services for managing poultry batches and
                                    feed inventory, our application provide advanced capabilities for identifying pure
                                    and crossbreeds, assessing quality levels, diagnosing poultry diseases, and
                                    evaluating disease risk level. Furthermore, our application is complemented by an
                                    IoT device for precise egg embryo prediction, ensuring a holistic solution for
                                    poultry farmers. There is an existing mobile application designed for chicken breed
                                    identification, named as "Chicken Breed Identifier" to accurately identify poultry
                                    chicken breeds with high accuracy. But reviews for that application reveals issues
                                    with accuracy, a restricted breed database, suboptimal user experience, and
                                    continued user dissatisfaction even after updates, underscoring the demand for an
                                    improved, precise, user-friendly, and secure solution. Moreover,unlike traditional
                                    poultry disease apps that serve as information resources, our application stands out
                                    by leveraging cutting-edge technology. It diagnoses diseases using user-uploaded
                                    fecal images and provides a risk level assessment, empowering poultry farmers with
                                    real-time, actionable insights for proactive disease management. Also, there are
                                    currently no dedicated applications for chicken meat quality assessment, leaving
                                    room for potential developments in this area. Additionally, the task of identifying
                                    egg embryos remains time-consuming and labor-intensive, causing significant losses
                                    to poultry farmers, and no new mechanisms have been introduced to address this
                                    issue.This is the first mobile application in the world and Sri Lanka which has all

                                    aiming
                                    to address the real-world needs of our primary stakeholders: farmers, veterinarians,
                                    consumers, and investigation officers. The application was put to the test with ten
                                    farmers actively involved in chicken livestock. They meticulously explored each
                                    feature,
                                    assessing its feasibility and efficiency. The unanimous verdict was that our
                                    application

                                    technologies to create a mobile
                                    application that not
                                    only enhances system efficiency but also drives cost savings. At its core, our
                                    application boasts meticulously crafted user interfaces, ensuring a seamless and
                                    effective interaction between users and the app's functionalities. The pillars of
                                    our
                                    product are user-friendliness, high-performance capabilities, and robust security
                                    measures, all designed to elevate the end-user experience. Our commitment to user
                                    simplicity is reflected in the user interfaces, which prioritize core objectives,
                                    sparing users from unnecessary complexity. We understand that software and code
                                    quality
                                    are pivotal factors in ensuring easy maintenance, which is why we've adhered to
                                    clean
                                    and consistent coding standards. We've chosen human-readable and logical code names,
                                    minimized complex conditional and nested logic, and eliminated redundant code to
                                    guarantee maintainability. Under the hood, our mobile application is powered by a
                                    stack
                                    of cutting-edge technologies. React Native takes the lead in shaping the frontend,
                                    delivering a smooth and responsive user interface while significantly reducing

                                    times. For the backend, we've harnessed the power of Node.js and Python, leveraging
                                    the
                                    Flask Python web framework to ensure robust performance. Our commitment to

                                    doesn't end there. Machine learning and image processing play pivotal roles in our
                                    application. Deep learning techniques come into play for freshness level
                                    identification
                                    and embryo identification, while support vector machine learning is instrumental in
                                    assessing the quality level of stored chicken. The identification of chicken
                                    diseases,
                                    as well as pure and cross-cattle breed types, is achieved through the application of
                                    the
                                    YoloV5 and Yolov8 algorithms. These algorithms offer real-time object detection,
                                    outpacing other methods in terms of speed and efficiency. Our dedication to quality
                                    doesn't stop at development. We conducted rigorous unit testing and integration
                                    testing
                                    to validate the product's appearance, performance, and functionality, ensuring that
